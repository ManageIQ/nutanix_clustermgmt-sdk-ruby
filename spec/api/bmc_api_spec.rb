  # @param cluster_ext_id Cluster UUID

  # @param if_match The If-Match request header makes the request conditional. When not provided, the server will respond with  an HTTP-428 (Precondition Required) response code indicating that the server requires the request to be conditional. The server will allow the successful completion of PUT and PATCH operations, if the resource matches the ETag value returned to the response of a GET operation. If the conditional does not match, then an HTTP-412 (Precondition Failed) response will be returned.
  # @param ntnx_request_id A unique identifier that is associated with each request. The provided value must be opaque and preferably in Universal Unique Identifier (UUID) format. This identifier is also used as an idempotence token for safely retrying requests in case of network errors. All the supported Nutanix API clients add this auto-generated request identifier to each request.
