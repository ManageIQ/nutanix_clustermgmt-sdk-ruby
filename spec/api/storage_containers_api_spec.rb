  # Create a Storage Container
  # Creates a new Storage Container with the specified configuration on the cluster identified by clusterâ€™s external identifier. The location header received in the API response contains the URL of the task object, which can be used to further track the status of the request.
  # @param x_cluster_id The external identifier of the remote cluster to forward the request.

This identifier is also used as an idempotence token for safely retrying requests in case of network errors. All the supported Nutanix API clients add this auto-generated request identifier to each request.

  # unit tests for list_data_stores_by_cluster_id
  # List datastores of a cluster
  # Lists all the datastores associated with Storage Containers from a cluster.
  # @param cluster_ext_id The cluster from which the datastores needs to be listed.
  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [Integer] :page A URL query parameter that specifies the page number of the result set. It must be a positive integer between 0 and the maximum number of pages that are available for that resource. Any number out of this range might lead to no results. 
  # @option opts [Integer] :limit A URL query parameter that specifies the total number of records returned in the result set.  Must be a positive integer between 1 and 100. Any number out of this range will lead to a validation error. If the limit is not provided, a default value of 50 records will be returned in the result set. 
  # @option opts [String] :filter A URL query parameter that allows clients to filter a collection of resources. The expression specified with $filter is evaluated for each resource in the collection, and only items where the expression evaluates to true are included in the response. Expression specified with the $filter must conform to the [OData V4.01](https://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.01/odata-v4.01-part1-protocol.html) URL conventions. For example, filter &#39;$filter&#x3D;name eq &#39;karbon-ntnx-1.0&#39; would filter the result on cluster name &#39;karbon-ntnx1.0&#39;, filter &#39;$filter&#x3D;startswith(name, &#39;C&#39;)&#39; would filter on cluster name starting with &#39;C&#39;.

The filter can be applied to the following fields: - affinityHostExtId - clusterExtId - clusterName - compressionDelaySecs - containerExtId - name - ownerExtId - replicationFactor - storagePoolExtId 
  # @option opts [String] :orderby A URL query parameter that allows clients to specify the sort criteria for the returned list of objects. Resources can be sorted in ascending order using asc or descending order using desc. If asc or desc are not specified, the resources will be sorted in ascending order by default. For example, &#39;$orderby&#x3D;templateName desc&#39; would get all templates sorted by templateName in descending order. The orderby can be applied to the following fields: - affinityHostExtId - clusterName - compressionDelaySecs - containerExtId - erasureCode - name - replicationFactor 
  # @option opts [String] :select A URL query parameter that allows clients to request a specific set of properties for each entity or complex type. Expression specified with the $select must conform to the [OData V4.01](https://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.01/odata-v4.01-part1-protocol.html) URL conventions. If a $select expression consists of a single select item that is an asterisk (i.e., *), then all properties on the matching resource will be returned. - affinityHostExtId - cacheDeduplication - clusterExtId - clusterName - compressionDelaySecs - containerExtId - erasureCode - erasureCodeDelaySecs - extId - hasHigherEcFaultDomainPreference - isCompressionEnabled - isEncrypted - isInlineEcEnabled - isInternal - isMarkedForRemoval - isNfsWhitelistInherited - isSoftwareEncryptionEnabled - links - logicalAdvertisedCapacityBytes - logicalExplicitReservedCapacityBytes - logicalImplicitReservedCapacityBytes - markedForRemoval - maxCapacityBytes - name - nfsWhitelistAddress - onDiskDedup - ownerExtId - replicationFactor - storagePoolExtId - tenantId

  # @param ext_id The external identifier of the Storage Container.
  # @param if_match The If-Match request header makes the request conditional. When not provided, the server will respond with  an HTTP-428 (Precondition Required) response code indicating that the server requires the request to be conditional. The server will allow the successful completion of PUT and PATCH operations, if the resource matches the ETag value returned to the response of a GET operation. If the conditional does not match, then an HTTP-412 (Precondition Failed) response will be returned.
